<h2 id="c1"><i>Foreword</i></h2>
<p>Natchez derives its name from the sun-worshiping Indian tribe, the Natchez,
who were the original owners of the area on which the city is located. It is situated
in Adams county, in the southwestern part of the state of Mississippi, on bluffs
200 feet high overlooking the Mississippi River, and is midway between Memphis
and New Orleans. It is accessible by railway, steamboat, motor highway and airway.
It is particularly proud of the Natchez Trace Parkway, a modern concrete
road over an old Indian trace or trail from Nashville to Natchez. This highway is
a link in one of the most important commercial and historic highways in the
United States reaching from Washington, D. C., to Mexico.</p>
<p>Today Natchez is a recognized center of interest because in the city and its
vicinity there are a greater number of original ante-bellum mansions than in
any other community in America&mdash;some 75 or more.</p>
<p>Natchez is the second oldest town in the United States, being next in age to
St. Augustine, Florida. It has lived under five different flags, each of which contributed
romantic flavor to the section. From 1714 to 1763 it was under the flag
of France; from 1764 to 1780 under the flag of England; and from 1780 to 1798
under the flag of Spain. In 1798 the first United States flag in the Lower Mississippi
Valley was raised in Natchez. Years after the raising of the &ldquo;stars and
stripes&rdquo;, another flag which some call &ldquo;the conquered banner&rdquo;, the beloved flag
of the Confederate States of America, floated over Natchez, 1861-&rsquo;65.</p>
<p>Natchez &ldquo;Under the Hill&rdquo; applies to that part of the town along the water
front and under the bluffs. It flourished during the heyday of steamboating on the
Mississippi. The inroads of the river have washed away the streets, and only a few
buildings remain. One very interesting home, &ldquo;Magnolia Vale&rdquo;, has been preserved
and is presented in this book.</p>
<p>The majority of these old homes contain original pieces of furniture, china,
coin silver service, draperies, carpets, wall decorations of exquisite workmanship,
huge mirrors in massive goldleaf frames, paintings bearing authentic signatures
of great masters, and hand-carved marble mantels. Laces, silks, and rich costumes
are displayed today by third, fourth and fifth generations.</p>
<p>It seems hardly possible that the world could move on and leave one small
community undisturbed in its ancient grandeur. The hand of destiny seems
indeed to uphold and enshrine this hallowed region. The estates have descended
from generation to generation, many of them today being owned and occupied
by descendants of the original owners.</p>
<p>Natchezians have been entirely satisfied, even proud, to be termed &ldquo;provincial&rdquo;.
A sense of inherent aristocracy has given these people a secure and placid
self-sufficiency which neither time nor stress of outside conditions nor the frettings
of progress can jar or mar.</p>
<p>Within the past ten years tourists have come. They clamored for entertainment.
And now, maintaining the established reputation for &ldquo;hospitality of the
true South&rdquo;, each Spring season Natchez opens wide her gates and invites the
world to come &ldquo;where the Old South still lives&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>The &ldquo;company dress&rdquo; of great-grandparents, which has been sacredly stored
away for scores of years, is brought out, and overnight the whole town, in manners
and dress, returns to those halcyon days of long ago. The streets are filled
with young and old in ante-bellum costumes. Sweet olive trees and magnolia
trees are in fragrant bloom, flower gardens are fresh and inviting, moss-draped
oaks ring with the song of native birds, the old homes are opened, treasures are
placed on view, and visitors are given a Southland welcome. The &ldquo;Pilgrimage&rdquo;
is on!</p>
<p>In addition to guided tours through ante-bellum houses special entertainments
are planned for each evening. Confederate balls, historical pageants, and many
other colorful events of the past are re-enacted. Spirituals are sung in old-fashioned
Negro churches where the &ldquo;pahson&rdquo; is eager to greet &ldquo;our white
friends&rdquo;. On spacious plantation grounds an old-time Southern barbecue prepared
by black mammies will be served.</p>
<p>A custom which has long prevailed in Natchez is the placing of coins in a
box for old darky beggars. On Saturdays every merchant observes &ldquo;Penny Day&rdquo;,
as it is called. It originated as a time saver, the box being placed in a convenient
location to avoid interruption of the store&rsquo;s business. There are many regular
&ldquo;customers&rdquo; for this feature and they are always welcome. &ldquo;Penny Day&rdquo; is a
thoughtful, good-natured gesture to the needy Negro from his &ldquo;white folks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Pictures of the old homes with accurate data and intimate stories and
legends constitute <i>Natchez, Symbol of the Old South</i>. Most of the photographs
are by Earl Norman.</p>
<p>A fascinating visit is given you by one who knows and loves the Southland.
You will be delighted and enriched.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><i>The Natchez Tribe</i></h2>
<p>A bronze plaque of a handsome Indian chief has been erected in a granite
wall overlooking the great &ldquo;Father of Waters&rdquo;, in memory of the Natchez Indian
tribe from which the city of Natchez derives its name.</p>
<p>The Natchez Indians were of Aztec origin and were in possession of the
Natchez country when the French came in 1700. They were sun-worshiping
Indians, and their great chief proclaimed himself &ldquo;brother to the Sun&rdquo;.</p>
<p>White Apple village, ten miles south of Natchez, was headquarters of the
Natchez tribe. They resented the invasion of the French explorers into their
country, and because of an insult (real or fancied) to their Chief by a French
Commandant, on November 28, 1729, the Indians slaughtered the entire French
settlement at Fort Rosalie. Later a French colony, with the assistance of the
Choctaws, a warring Indian tribe, annihilated every member of the Natchez tribe.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly this was the country of the Natchez tribe, and the beautiful
plaque is a deserved reminder of the days when the land was one hundred per
cent American.</p>

</div></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 id="c3"><i>Natchez Trace</i></h2>
<p>Opportunity for easy travel, over trails that were once Indian foot paths, is
offered now to motorists on perfect concrete highways. Modern roads, which slowly
evolved from dirt roads to paved highways, stretch from Nashville, Tennessee,
in a continuous smooth concrete ribbon to Natchez, on the great Mississippi
River.</p>
<p>Days when the beauty of the Southland could be viewed only from a steamboat
deck; days when transportation of passenger and freight could be handled
only by oxcart or slow stage coach or horse and buggy (a three-weeks journey
from Nashville to Natchez) are gone forever, and soon the Deep South will be
directly connected by a day&rsquo;s pleasant journey with all the cities and towns along
the Natchez Trace.</p>
<p>By treaty with Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian tribes the United States Government
in 1801 secured a permit to open the Natchez Trace as a wagon road
over which the mails could travel.</p>
<p>That same trail or &ldquo;trace&rdquo; from Nashville to Natchez is 500 miles of consecutive
beauty spots along continuous acres of parkways and historic highways.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roan Fleming Byrnes, serving as President of the Natchez Trace Highway
Committee, in a recent publication says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The ancient trail was traveled by most of the well-known figures in the
history of our country: Jefferson Davis; Peggy and Lorenzo Dow, the
revivalists; the fast riding John Morgan; the famous Audubon. Lafayette
rode over the Trace during his visit to the Natchez country; Aaron Burr
was given his preliminary trial for treason under two liveoaks just beside
the Trace; Meriwether Lewis died at an inn on the Trace when returning
from his Western explorations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life of Andrew Jackson is closely interwoven with the windings
of the Natchez Trace. At Springfield plantation, in Jefferson county,
Mississippi, Jackson was married to Rachael Robards; and, near Nashville,
Tennessee, is the &lsquo;Hermitage&rsquo;, the home he built for Rachael.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was when marching his rejected Tennessee militia homeward over
the Trace from Natchez to Nashville in 1813 that Jackson acquired
his famous nickname, &lsquo;Old Hickory&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The unusual beauty of the deep cut roadways, worn down by travel throughout
the years, and the overlapping, moss-draped trees, will be preserved as far as
possible.</p>
<p>Many of these old roads running into Natchez lead through deep, tunnel-like
ways whose sides are sheer walls ten to eighty feet high and draped with long
fronds of overhanging Spanish moss.</p>
<p>These roadways of tunnels and curves are weird and beautiful, affording an
irresistible attraction for all travelers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c4"><i>Airlie</i></h2>
<p>Built prior to 1790, &ldquo;Airlie&rdquo; is a rambling, wide-spread building of cottage
type, on a rolling elevation at the end of Myrtle street. It attracts attention
through its unusual simplicity of exterior. Its architecture is entirely different
from other ante-bellum homes in the community.</p>
<p>This great departure from the usual style is due to the age of Airlie. Its
original building date is ahead of all the available history of Natchez.</p>
<p>Additions have been made, from time to time, until today Airlie stands twelve
rooms broad, reaching a row of venerable cedars with their swaying moss which
sweeps the eaves of this old home of the Ayres P. Merrill family.</p>
<p>The central portion is built on old Spanish style, with beams and timbers held
together by wooden pegs; later additions show that these were made by somewhat
improved methods.</p>
<p>Airlie is often referred to as &ldquo;the old Buckner home&rdquo;. It was occupied by the
Buckner family at the time of its first recorded history and during the War Between
the States when conflicts at Airlie left blood stains on its floors and walls which
are clearly visible today.</p>
<p>This house was for a time used as a hospital for Northern soldiers.</p>
<p>When Airlie passed from the Buckner family it became the property of
another family of distinction, that of Ayres P. Merrill, whose descendants occupy
Airlie today, with its treasure of rosewood and mahogany antiques.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">

<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="800" height="553" />
</div>
<p>The present Merrill family are the proud possessors of hundreds of pieces of
Du Barry and other imported china from France and Belgium, as well as a silver
service of rare design and sacred antiquity which might well excite the envy of
Royalty itself.</p>
<p>There are many persons who believe Airlie was the first residence built in the
Natchez territory. No definite date in authentic records can be found.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="Arlington" width="800" height="678" />
</div>
<p>Where Natchez&rsquo; Main street ends, the great wide gates of Arlington open.
Live oaks with pendant gray moss line the driveway, which winds through beds
of vari-colored irises to one of the most distinctively attractive ante-bellum homes
in the South.</p>
<p>Of Southern Colonial type, constructed of red brick with stately white Tuscan
columns supporting the upper story gallery, Arlington today, more than a century
old, presents a magnificent appearance.</p>
<p>The great carved entrance door leading to the spacious hall is crowned with
intricately wrought fanlights, and the broad veranda is approached by wide

<p>Arlington was built for Mrs. Jane White, eldest daughter of Pierre Surget, who
came from France in the early days of Natchez. The house was completed about
1820 but on the very first night of her residence in the home of her heart&rsquo;s desire
Mrs. White passed away suddenly. Many tales have been told of a mysterious
death but none has been verified. At her death Mrs. White left Arlington and all
its treasures to her sister, Mrs. Bingaman.</p>

<p>Five generations of the Pierre Surget family occupied Arlington. Each in
turn contributed to its wealth of rare treasures. The original furniture was imported
from France.</p>
<p>Across the broad hallway which is hung with rare paintings by old-world
masters such as Vernet, Baroccio, Carlo Dolci, and Coccanari, is the Music Room
which contains a spinet more than three hundred years old. There are family
portraits in this room&mdash;some of musicians in the family&mdash;by such renowned
artists as Sully, Audubon, Albani, Fidanza, and Maratti.</p>
<p>The Library holds some five thousand books.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hubert Barnum, the present owner of Arlington, comes from a long line
of Natchez aristocracy. Arlington was given her as a wedding gift from her husband,
who recently passed away. Mrs. Barnum while keeping the home atmosphere
of Arlington has made it, also, a veritable private museum, rich in beauty, in rare
books, and antiques.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><i>Auburn</i></h2>
<p>Built in 1812, a full century and a quarter ago, by Dr. Stephen Duncan,
&ldquo;Auburn&rdquo; mansion is noted today as in bygone historic days for its architectural
beauty and the natural beauty of its surrounding acres.</p>
<p>Auburn is a magnificent red brick structure with great white columns supporting
its broad front galleries. The bricks were made on the premises by slave
labor. On the first floor are spacious drawing rooms, a large dining room, a family
dining room, library, smoking room, and two hallways. Above stairs are six huge
bedrooms with high ceilings.</p>
<p>In the rear of the main mansion is a two-storied brick kitchen which is connected
with the main building by a flagged patio. The servants&rsquo; quarters are
above with the kitchen and pantries on the ground floor. The kitchen has the
giant fireplace with cranes and pots and the old-time &ldquo;spit&rdquo; where meats were
roasted.</p>
<p>Entrance to Auburn is through a classic doorway which has been aptly called
&ldquo;an architect&rsquo;s dream of beauty&rdquo;.</p>

</div></div>
<p>Inside the house there is a majestic spiral stairway rising to the grand high
hallway, without support except at its base. This amazing feature intrigues the
imagination.</p>
<p>In early days Auburn entertained many celebrities, among them Henry Clay,
Edward Everett Hale, and John Howard Payne. The same gracious hospitality
maintains today.</p>
<p>Auburn is the property of the city of Natchez by deed of gift from Stephen
Duncan, and is used as the deed stipulates for the &ldquo;amusement, entertainment,
and recreation, without cost or monetary consideration, of Natchez citizens&rdquo;. It
is the handsome headquarters of several distinguished local clubs.</p>
<p>The women&rsquo;s clubs of Natchez have undertaken the task of furnishing the
lower floor with valuable antiques of the period of its original furnishings.</p>
<p>The acreage surrounding it is known as Duncan Park in compliment to the
Duncan family who gave it to the city. It contains huge, aged, moss-draped oaks,
alluring sweet olive trees, famous magnolias, shrubbery and vines, old-fashioned
gardens, a golf course, and playground with swings and merry-go-rounds used
every day in the year for the health and frolic of children.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="Belmont" width="800" height="434" />
</div>
<p>Sturdy as the Rock of Gibraltar stands this imposing Neo-Greek mansion. It
was known originally as &ldquo;Cleremont&rdquo;, and was built in the early 40&rsquo;s by one
Loxley Thistle.</p>
<p>Storm and strife have beaten against the doors of this stronghold but it was
built after a disastrous tornado which put a great fear in the minds of builders
of that period, and Belmont (as it was renamed) was constructed to resist fierce
storms, although at the same time exquisite lines of beauty were maintained.</p>
<p>This place with its thirty acres of land has changed hands oftener than any
ante-bellum home in Natchez. Its history is broken and uncertain. It was undoubtedly
built by imported craftsmen who had the help of local carpenters and slave
labor.</p>
<p>Many prominent families of Natchez are identified with Belmont at some
period in its history. Within its fort-like walls Natchez elite often sipped rare old
wine from its private sub-cellar in frequent celebrations.</p>
<p>Belmont has its ghost story of whispering souls wandering through the high-ceilinged
halls&mdash;ghosts created to scare the slaves, and &ldquo;whispers&rdquo; which proved
to be the swishing of chimney swallows rushing in and out of their nests.</p>
<p>The approach to Belmont is a majestic line of moss-draped cedars and giant
oak trees standing sentinel-like over the gardens of days long passed.</p>
<p>Louis Fry, present owner, plans the complete restoration of Belmont. It may
soon ring with echoes of happier days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c8"><i>Belvidere</i></h2>
<p>On Homochitto street, in the shadow of magnificent &ldquo;Dunleith&rdquo;, is a simple
white cottage, &ldquo;Belvidere&rdquo;, which for generations has been the home of the
Henderson family.</p>
<p>Originally Belvidere was the center of a fourteen acre tract of wooded land
which was the property of Christopher Miller, who was secretary to the Spanish
Governor of Natchez, Gayoso de Lemos. The Hendersons are descendants of
Christopher Miller.</p>
<p>Simple and unostentatious this small cottage stands with her very toes, as it
were, on the street where once broad acreage spread. These acres gave space in
later years for a public school and a paved highway.</p>
<p>Belvidere is more than 100 years old, and has been for more than a century
owned and occupied by one family.</p>
<p>It is simply furnished, and much of it is the original furniture, more than 100
years old. Two pictures of special interest adorn the walls, silhouettes of Samuel
Brooks and his wife&mdash;&ldquo;the first Mayor of Natchez and his Lady&rdquo;. These pictures
were made in 1753.</p>
<p>Rare Venetian glass and china and many exquisite pieces of porcelain are
found in Belvidere.</p>
<p>The property is now owned and occupied by Mrs. Florence Henderson Kelly
and her son and daughter, Thomas G. and Ellen N.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><i>Brandon Hall</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="Brandon Hall" width="700" height="623" />
</div>
<p>This old home is not in the immediate Natchez area but its owner and his
descendants are so closely allied with all that is Natchez that Brandon Hall is
rightfully considered a Natchez asset and is included in its list of ante-bellum
homes.</p>
<p>Gerard Brandon of Ireland came to Natchez prior to the Revolutionary War,
and more than a century ago &ldquo;Selma Plantation&rdquo;, from whose acres came the
grounds of Brandon Hall, was built by him. Mr. Brandon was a successful farmer
and was one of the original pecan growers in the county. He came to Natchez
from South Carolina.</p>
<p>Brandon Hall was built by Gerard Brandon the Third in 1856, and stands
today a splendid monument to a grand old family. It is sturdily constructed. Its
timbers are secured with thumb screws and wooden pegs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c10"><i>Cherry Grove</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p13a.jpg" alt="Cherry Grove" width="800" height="561" />
</div>
<p>Built of primeval timbers, cut and hewn by slaves on the place, the old home
at Cherry Grove plantation &ldquo;sits tight&rdquo; secured by dependable wooden pegs. It
was built in 1788 when time and expense of labor were of little consideration,
and nails and modern building equipment were not available.</p>
<p>Pierre Surget of La Rochelle, France, built this Spanish style house, on a
Spanish land grant, for his wife, Katherine d&rsquo;Hubert, and from this couple have
come some of Natchez&rsquo; most prominent families.</p>
<p>Mr. Surget was a seaman for many years before coming to the Natchez country,
and Cherry Grove was built with the sturdiness of a seaworthy vessel.</p>
<p>The home has never passed out of the Surget family. Its present owner, Mrs.
Carlotta Surget McKittrick, now possesses the original Spanish land grant made
to Pierre Surget in the 1700&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In a small cemetery within sight of the old home, enclosed by an imported
iron fence, lie the bodies of Pierre Surget and his wife, Katherine.</p>
<p>Descendants of the Surget slaves remain in the &ldquo;quarters&rdquo; to look after the
place, and to plant and gather cotton from its vast acres.</p>
<p>The house is unoccupied. Much of the original furnishing remains intact, and
a Surget heir is today sole owner of the quaint old dwelling of her illustrious
forbears.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><i>The Briers</i></h2>

<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p14a.jpg" alt="The Briers" width="800" height="427" />
</div>
<p>Could Jefferson Davis and his beloved wife, Varina, return to The Briers
today they would be pleased to find it in a perfect state of preservation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Briers&rdquo;, a typical story-and-a-half country home, was given to Louise
Kemp at the time of her marriage to William Burr Howell, who was a cousin of
Aaron Burr. And here Varina Howell was born May 7, 1826. This home was the
scene of Varina&rsquo;s marriage to Jefferson Davis on February 12, 1845. Mr. Davis
later became &ldquo;President of the Confederacy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The house is situated on a knoll overlooking the Mississippi river, with a view
of the cotton lands of Louisiana. The view of the Mississippi shown in the end papers
was taken from the lawn of this house. It stands in the center of a forest of
oak, pine, and pecan trees, and can be reached by only one narrow winding roadway,
through deep woods, around bayous and ravines, hanging heavy with bushes
and brambles. The house is quite similar to the Virginia type of country home.</p>
<p>When the present owner, Mrs. W. W. Wall, purchased The Briers a few years
ago, it was in a sad state of dilapidation. By great and loving labor, and generous
expenditure of money and time, The Briers today is in perfect condition. It is
now a charming credit to Natchez and to the memory of Jefferson Davis and his
wife, Varina.</p>
<p>The early architectural lines have been followed and materials similar to
the original ones have been used. The broad veranda across the entire front,
with many small wooden pillars and hand-turned spindle bannisters, the wide
entrance steps, the quaint old dormer windows with their 12-pane sashes and
heavy green blinds, form the perfect picture of the original plantation home of
the Howells and Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the floor plan is pleasing. The furniture includes many reproductions
of rare original pieces. There is a restful, sacred serenity in The
Briers worthy of its illustrious original owners.</p>
<p>For the pleasure of visitors from the outside world, the present mistress keeps
open house throughout the year, and hundreds of interested persons from every
part of the United States pass through the portals of this home&mdash;the shrine of
Jefferson Davis and Varina Howell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c12"><i>The Burn</i></h2>
<p>Another old home that was once situated in the center of vast acreage is
&ldquo;The Burn&rdquo;. Streets have been cut through, lots sold and residences erected until
today this quaint old home, originally the residence of John P. Walworth of Ohio,
is in the very heart of the residence district of Natchez.</p>
<p>While the &ldquo;old Walworth home&rdquo;, as it was so long known, was built about
1834, its most interesting history is concerned with the war of 1861-65.</p>
<p>The Burn is a homey-looking house of the story-and-a-half cottage type with
spacious halls and nineteen rooms in the main building. High ceilings, mahogany
woodwork, and wide, hand-rubbed board floors are indicative of its early period.</p>
<p>By reason of its spacious and numerous rooms, and its accessibility to the
river front and the Battery, &ldquo;The Burn&rdquo; was made headquarters for the Federal
Artillery in the War Between the States. With only 24 hours&rsquo; notice the family
left their comfortable home to be occupied by the enemy. Major Coleman and his
soldiers took possession of The Burn, and today on a window pane in the house
can be seen the Major&rsquo;s full name as cut there by a diamond more than seventy-five
years ago.</p>
<p>Within the last few years The Burn has been purchased by S. B. Laub, who
is a direct descendant of the Beekman family. Mr. and Mrs. Laub have reclaimed
and rebuilt every part of the old house with strict observance of the original
architecture.</p>

</div>
<p>A letter from the granddaughter of the original owner of The Burn written
to its present owners and published in the <i>Natchez Democrat</i> tells the complete
story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Burn property when purchased by John P. Walworth in 1834 extended
from Union street to Clifton Heights. The home was erected the
same year, and got its name from the Scotch, meaning &lsquo;The Brook&rsquo;, which
ran through the property where Pearl street now is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Architects and builders were brought from the East, the finest that
could be found. It took more than a year to build, and has been compared
to the Temple, for scarcely the sound of hammer was heard in its erection.
The grand old home has stood fire, storm, and war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Grant&rsquo;s army took possession of the town, The Burn became
army headquarters, and was later turned into a hospital for Union soldiers.
The wonderful old trees, the lawn and gardens fell before the axe and
sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After war clouds rolled away it was restored to its owner in a ruined
condition. Generations have passed over its threshold loving it as a living
being. The sons of the family bravely answered their country&rsquo;s call to arms
and returned with untarnished records. Many brides have left its loving
care. The mystery of life, birth and death have hallowed its walls with
pride and sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We relinquish our ownership rights into other hands; our escutcheon
unsullied by debt or shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rejoice that it will be again a loved home, and may the happiness
of the Walworth name continue to follow and bless the present owners.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c13"><i>Choctaw</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="Choctaw" width="631" height="800" />
</div>
<p>Such dilapidated grandeur cannot be found in all the country around as one
beholds at Choctaw. &ldquo;Built to endure and determined not to fall&rdquo; seems to ring
from every stone and pillar of this gigantic old mansion. Once it was the center
of a city block but now on the busy corner of Wall and High streets traffic of
every sort brushes its very door.</p>
<p>Because this property was so long owned and occupied by a Natchez philanthropist,
Alvarez Fisk, &ldquo;Choctaw&rdquo; is known far and wide as the &ldquo;old Fisk home&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This stately example of classic architecture was built by one Sarah Neibert.
Records show that it was deeded to Alvarez Fisk about 1840. Fisk was born in
Massachusetts in 1788. During the early 90&rsquo;s Choctaw was used as &ldquo;Stanton College
for Women&rdquo;, and many Natchez women were educated there.</p>
<p>Time and decay have had their turn at Choctaw. The great stone pillars stand
proudly, and boldly present a magnificent front; exquisite fanlights adorn the
great doors which were built extra wide to accommodate the hoopskirted ladies
of early days; walls and lofty ceilings stand in sturdy defiance of wind and rain
and vandalism, and yet the crumbling corners, the tumbling formal entrance,
and the rundown appearance of Choctaw produce a feeling of solemn sadness.</p>
<p>The foundation and walls of Choctaw are firm, and the day may come when
this old palace will be restored to its former beauty and glory.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/p16a.jpg" alt="Concord" width="800" height="590" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Concord&rdquo; was built in 1788 by Don Gayoso de Lemos, representative in the
Natchez Territory of the King of Spain.</p>
<p>The name, &ldquo;Concord&rdquo;, was chosen because the Governor felt that this word
expressed the status of his people living in peace and amity.</p>
<p>The dwelling was two-and-a-half stories. The lower floor was of brick and
the upper portion was frame. There was a driveway beneath the long flight of
steps at the front entrance. The house was richly furnished with importations
from Spain.</p>
<p>A few years ago &ldquo;Concord&rdquo; was destroyed by fire and Natchez lost an intriguing
landmark.</p>
<p>Today the handsome iron-railed outside double stairway marks the spot that
was once the ruling center of government, and the social hub during the colorful
days of the Spanish regime.</p>

</div>
<p>When &ldquo;Cottage Gardens&rdquo; was built, some hundred and forty years ago,
Natchez was young, and homes at that time were of compact, inconspicuous
design.</p>
<p>The land upon which this home stands was a part of the original Spanish
grant to Don Jose Vidal, a young Spanish nobleman. &ldquo;Cottage Gardens&rdquo; was so
named because of the beautiful gardens surrounding the cottage. It is recorded
that these gardens were destroyed during the War Between the States when Union
soldiers used the grounds as a pasture for their horses.</p>
<p>Don Jose Vidal was a military governor and Captain in a Spanish army. His
duties took him across the river from Natchez to a place now known as Vidalia.
When his beloved young wife died her tomb was built on a high bluff on the
estate overlooking the Mississippi River. While engaged in official service across
the broad waters, Capt. Vidal could look out at any moment and see the spot
where his beautiful Donna Vidal was buried. Don Jose is buried in a Natchez
Cemetery. A great shaft has been erected above his grave and is inscribed with a
lengthy epitaph which mentions that &ldquo;he was a friend of his Sovereign&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Cottage Gardens has been for several generations owned and occupied by the
Foster family. Although the exterior is on simple lines, the house is surprisingly
spacious. The wide hall through the center contains a stairway of unusual architectural
attractiveness. Its broad steps with mahogany handrailing lead up along
the left wall almost to the ceiling, then leaving the wall the stairway crosses the
hall in a graceful spiral curve and the ascending flight is finished along the right
wall.</p>
<p>At the rear end of the hall is a beautiful arch and doorway with fanlight above
and plain side glass. It is a facsimile of the entrance door at the opposite end of
the hall.</p>
<p>From the present owners, the Foster family, comes Mary Kate Norman, the
wife of Karl Norman, whose photographic art in picturing the old homes of
Natchez has given him a prominent place among artists of the South.</p>

<p>By recent engineering survey Highway No. 61 from Memphis to New Orleans
passes the grounds that once formed a part of D&rsquo;Evereux acres. Motorists on this
highway, when within a mile of Natchez, can see this mansion, in perfect architecture,
standing like a great Greek temple near the roadway. Sweeping tropical
moss hangs from the sentinel oaks which guard this magnificent home.</p>
<p>Built in 1840 for William St. John Elliott and his wife, it was given her family
name, &ldquo;D&rsquo;Evereux&rdquo;, and this home, one of the most spacious in the community,
was the scene of many happy affairs for the socially prominent.</p>
<p>Great double drawing rooms and a banquet room, while not containing the
original furnishings, show woodwork and walls, hand-turned railings and doorways,
evidence of the excellent taste of the builders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>After more than forty years the master-owner of D&rsquo;Evereux died. The home
was closed for a long while; later the widow with some of her young relatives
opened the mansion and it became again the scene of many joyful gatherings.</p>
<p>Upon the death of Mrs. Elliott, &ldquo;D&rsquo;Evereux&rdquo; was willed to her niece, Mrs.
Margaret Martin Shields. During Mrs. Shields&rsquo; occupancy, it was selected as the
most perfect home, in style and setting, in the entire Southland, and for this
reason it is shown in that exquisite motion picture, &ldquo;The Heart of Maryland&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Within the past few years D&rsquo;Evereux has been purchased by Miss Myra Smith
of Chicago. With great pride in the ownership of one of the South&rsquo;s most majestic
ante-bellum homes, Miss Smith has restored every portion of the old home, which
today presents such magnificent perfection as to bring forth exclamations of wonder
from all who travel that section of the Natchez Trace highway.</p>

<h2 id="c18"><i>Dunleith</i></h2>
<p>This house, built in 1849 by Gen. Dahlgreen, is situated in perfectly kept terraced
grounds, surrounded by symmetrically planted oak trees which have grown
to giant size. A long driveway from the tall iron gate at the street entrance to
the porch steps bring one to &ldquo;Dunleith&rdquo;, a veritable Greek temple.</p>
<p>Dunleith is almost one hundred years old. The land on which it stands is part
of a Spanish grant of 700 acres, and was the site of the original home which was
destroyed by fire (caused by lightning) in 1845. In the rear of the present Dunleith
are the stables which belonged to the original house.</p>
<p>At the death of Leslie Carpenter a few years ago this property was inherited
by his widow and her son, J. N. Carpenter. No more perfect example of a Colonial
mansion of the Old South can be found. The house and grounds are under the
constant care of scientific gardeners and caretakers.</p>
<p>The story of Dunleith is incomplete until its legend has been told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At the court of Louis Philippe, last King of France, a lady in waiting was
Miss Isabel Percy, who visited Dunleith to try to forget a terrible heart
hurt. She played the harp, and sang in a beautiful voice. At evening, just at
dusk, her sweet mournful songs can still be heard in the parlors of Dunleith.
When twilight turns to darkness, the swish of her silken skirts can be
heard as she ascends the broad stairway to her private rooms above.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="Edgewood" width="800" height="562" />
</div>
<p>Edgewood, erected in 1855, shared with &ldquo;Mount Repose&rdquo; the distinction of
being a part of the original Bisland estate. It is a simple plantation home, located
on the Pine Ridge road, and is today occupied by direct descendants of the
original owner, who maintain the estate as nearly as possible in accord with the
original plans.</p>
<p>Situated on rolling greensward with a declivity at the rear, the house is two
stories in front and three in the back. Straight, square lines are observed in its
architecture. A porch extends across the entire front supported by double white
columns. The outlook is into a group of restful, moss-covered oaks in the midst
of which is a natural pond.</p>
<p>Edgewood is the home of Mr. and Mrs. S. H. Lamden, who with their young
sons, S. H. III and Waldo, occupy this home of their forefathers. It is kept, from
day to day, in the same style of ante-bellum home as in days gone by.</p>
<p>Many descendants of the original slaves of the Lamdens live today in the
&ldquo;quarters&rdquo; on the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<div class="img" id="fig42">
<img src="images/p21a.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="729" height="600" />
</div>
<p>From &ldquo;Beaupres&rdquo; and other old plantations have come many possessions of
rarest antiquity to Edgewood. There are portraits by the famous artist James Reed
Lamden; among these is an exquisite portrait of his mother, who was Prudence
Harrison; another is of Dr. John Flavel Carmichael, a member of the original
staff of George Washington, painted by Gilbert Stuart.</p>
<p>Furnishings at Edgewood are of soft tones in rosewood and mahogany. Drawing
rooms, dining room, and bed rooms are filled with valuable antiques&mdash;all in
daily use by the present family. Edgewood retains today all the charm and beauty
that it had nearly a hundred years ago.</p>

<h2 id="c20"><i>Elgin</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="Elgin" width="700" height="640" />
</div>
<p>The history of &ldquo;Elgin&rdquo; dates from about 1838 when it was owned by the Dunbar
family, and was named Elgin for the Dunbar estate in Scotland.</p>
<p>It is about eight miles from Natchez, and for many years was the home of the
Jenkins family, whose descendants are prominent citizens of Natchez. Mr. Jenkins
was a member of the Academy of Natural Science, and gave much time and scientific
attention to the grounds of Elgin.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned frame building with spacious halls and wide galleries stands
on a knoll in a broad clearing surrounded by a forest of oaks and pecans.</p>
<p>In 1914 Capt. Jenkins sold Elgin to the late Thornton Green of Michigan.
Prior to that transfer &ldquo;Elgin&rdquo; while changing owners, each time was bought by
descendants of its original owner.</p>
<p>Elgin was far-famed for its gardens and orchards, traces of which remain today
and are being reclaimed by the latest purchasers of the property, Mr. and Mrs.
W. S. R. Beane of New York and Natchez. The Beanes will make &ldquo;Elgin&rdquo; their
permanent home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c21"><i>Elms</i></h2>
<p>Amid great elm trees and sturdy liveoaks is a wide, rambling house, its galleries
bannistered with graceful iron grill encircling three sides of the structure.
This is &ldquo;Elms&rdquo;, it is the home of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Kellogg. It is a close neighbor
of the &ldquo;Greenleaves&rdquo; estate.</p>
<p>Elms was for a long time known as &ldquo;the old Drake home&rdquo;. Its intricate rambling
porticos, unusual stairway, and beautiful gardens came to the Kelloggs by
fortunate inheritance. Mrs. Kellogg is a direct descendant of the Drake family.
Benjamin Drake was president of Elizabeth College, which has the distinction of
being the first college in the United States to permit the teaching of branches of
higher education to women.</p>
<p>With the home and its acres of lovely gardens Mrs. Kellogg inherited a house
filled with rare antique rosewood furniture.</p>
<p>The main building of Elms, a two-and-a-half-story structure, was built in the
late 1700&rsquo;s. The exact date is not disclosed by available old records. As the property
passed from descendant to descendant rooms have been added.</p>
<p>A striking feature of the house is a lacy wrought-iron stairway unlike any other
in all America and believed to have been imported from Portugal. The stairway
is built in a corridor, and is in harmony with the generous display of dainty, hand-turned
work around the outer galleries.</p>
<p>Ceilings are low and give Spanish atmosphere to the architecture.</p>
<p>A series of old call bells, each with a different tone to indicate the location,
are still in use in the various rooms.</p>
<p>The famous gardens in the rear have been reclaimed by the present mistress
of Elms. Winding walks lead along flower beds of old-fashioned petunias, brilliant
verbenas, phlox, roses and azaleas, edged with prim cut boxwood, while giant
yuccas stand stiff as formal guards with white plumed headdress.</p>
<p>A great part of the original Elms estate has been sold, and today one of
Natchez&rsquo; modern school buildings stands across the street, giving the children of
this school a daily picture lesson of home and life of the proud Old South.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig45">
<img src="images/p23.jpg" alt="Ellicott Hill" width="800" height="544" />
</div>
<p>Artists and architects from far and near come to see the quaint old house,
known as &ldquo;Connelly&rsquo;s Tavern&rdquo;, on Ellicott Hill. It is a sturdy, perfectly proportioned
old house, built of brick and wood, its timbers said to have come from
abandoned sailing vessels.</p>
<p>The style of architecture is early Spanish. It stands on a high elevation, overlooking
with aristocratic disdain the industrial enterprises which have come in
during the years to supplant the once exclusive neighborhood of its original outlook.
In early days, about the end of the Civil War, the place was known as
&ldquo;Gilreath&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The tavern was built in 1795. It has been occupied by many distinguished
families.</p>
<p>The records show that at one time it was the home of &ldquo;The Natchez High
School&rdquo;. It was so used just after the War between the States, when it was
purchased by Wilson R. Gilreath.</p>
<p>Within the last few years the old building has commanded the greatest degree
of public interest. Its historic value is unmatched. In addition to serving as the
abode of many celebrated men, it attained fame as Connelly&rsquo;s Tavern when
Aaron Burr and Blennerhasset met therein for secret conferences.</p>
<p>The most outstanding historic fact of the old Hill, itself, is that it is the spot
whereon Col. Andrew Ellicott raised the first United States flag in February 1797
over the District of Natchez. Since that episode the spot has been known as
&ldquo;Ellicott Hill&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Dilapidation followed the wake of time. However, so sturdy were its timbers
and so solid its foundation, it was possible to restore the old building on the hill.</p>
<p>The work of restoration has been accomplished by the Natchez Garden Club.
Every old line has been carefully retained. Concrete floors of the kitchen and
Tap Room, plastered walls, cypress grill work, solid doors, and roof are exact
replicas of the originals. The old retaining walls and moats of brick have been
replaced as originally at great cost. Today Ellicott Hill is shining in the full
resplendency of its original glory. It is the present home of the Natchez Garden
Club.</p>

<h2 id="c23"><i>Elmscourt</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="Elmscourt" width="800" height="365" />
</div>
<p>A short drive from Natchez, over a modern highway which was originally an
Indian trail, through iron gates into a virgin forest, brings one a first glimpse of
Elmscourt.</p>
<p>This mansion was erected about the year 1810 by Louis Evans, who was the
first Sheriff of Adams county. He occupied it until 1851, at which time Frank
Surget bought it for his daughter Jane as a gift when she married Ayers P.
Merrill. It is said that Frank Surget was one of the three multi-millionaires in
the United States at that time.</p>
<p>Jane and her husband opened wide the doors of their palatial home. General
U. S. Grant was a frequent guest of Elmscourt, and by reason of this friendly
contact, Ayres Merrill was appointed Minister to Belgium when Grant became
President.</p>
<p>Elmscourt was originally Colonial in architecture but to please his wife Mr.
Merrill changed it into an Italian Renaissance villa. The exquisite lacy iron work
around its long galleries was imported from Belgium.</p>
<p>The dainty antique furnishings in parlors, library, and dining room are in
perfect harmony with this period of architecture. Many original pieces are
retained. At the death of Ayres P. Merrill &ldquo;Elmscourt&rdquo; descended to his son,
Ayres P. Merrill Jr., and was sold by him to James Surget, who gave it to his
daughter, Carlotta, on the occasion of her marriage to David McKittrick. Thus
Elmscourt was again the property of a Surget.</p>
<p>The McKittrick family have lived in Elmscourt many years. They have added
to the valuable collection of antique furnishings, Mrs. McKittrick bringing in
superb pieces from Surget heirlooms.</p>
<p>An outstanding piece of Elmscourt&rsquo;s furnishing is a serving table, made for
the Duke of Devonshire and bearing his coat-of-arms. It was a gift to Mrs.
McKittrick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>In the dining room still swings the old hand-carved punka of colonial days.
At every meal, a servant stands at the end of the long dining room and by rope-and-arm-power
keeps the great fan (punka) gently stirring, or creating, refreshing
breezes for the comfort of the diners.</p>
<p>The lighting of Elmscourt is the early designed candle arrangement. Over
doorways, in chandeliers, sconces, and wall brackets hundreds of candles cast
their welcoming, soft glow, and add undying romance to the family portrait
gallery and rich rosewood furniture.</p>
<p>Each Spring season when tourists wend their way to Natchez for its Spring
festivities, the McKittricks of Elmscourt give their famous &ldquo;Ball of a Thousand
Candles&rdquo;. Lords and Ladies, the elite of Natchez, in costume of days of long ago,
greet their guests, and Elmscourt becomes today what it has been in the past, an
alluring setting for colorful gatherings of notables.</p>

</div></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c24"><i>Glenfield</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig50">
<img src="images/p25a.jpg" alt="Glenfield" width="800" height="509" />
</div>
<p>Turn to the right on the first gravel road leading from Canal street and within
a stone&rsquo;s throw of the paved highway nestles a quaint old brick cottage surrounded
by giant oaks and cedars. It is &ldquo;Glenfield&rdquo;, the home of Mrs. Lee Field and her
family.</p>
<p>Glenfield was built in 1812 by Charles B. Green. It is of Gothic design and is
constructed of red brick and hand-hewn timbers. Like many of the old homes,
&ldquo;Glenfield&rdquo; demonstrates two distinct types of architecture. One part is low ceilinged
with brick floors, while another part has high ceilings, broad board floors,
and ornate windows with heavy hand-made blinds.</p>
<p>Glenfield contains many rare pieces of antique furniture. A most interesting
piece is an old spinning wheel, a family heirloom. It is made of hickory and is
brown with age. Charred spots bear silent evidence to the old wheel&rsquo;s narrow
escape from destruction when Indians set fire to the covered wagon bearing it
while its pioneer owner was bringing his family and household goods to this
section. Everything was destroyed except a few choice pieces. As one turns the
wheel today it seems to hum a chant of toil, trials and tribulations.</p>
<p>Glenfield was originally &ldquo;Glencannon&rdquo;, named for its former owner, William
Cannon. The property is part of an original Spanish grant to John Gerault under
Don Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, who was then governor of the Natchez Territory.</p>
<p>During the War Between the States &ldquo;Glenfield&rdquo; was a scene of battle, and
bullet holes made in that conflict can be seen today in vivid contrast to the peace
which now pervades the restful old home amid vine-covered bayous and hills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c25"><i>Glenwood</i></h2>
<p>Conditions at Glenwood are not conducive to pride in the hearts of Natchez
people, and yet it is doubtful if any tourist leaves Natchez without hearing, in
some way, about this dilapidated old place. As all things are good or bad by
comparison, it may not be amiss when depicting the glory of Natchez to glimpse
the other side.</p>
<p>A Northern tourist upon seeing Glenwood (known today as &ldquo;Goat Castle&rdquo;)
said, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know whether to cry or swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenwood is the home of Richard Dana, a man of aristocratic breeding and
birth, and of his guardian, Miss Martha Dockery, a stalwart, dark-eyed woman
who has been for many years in charge of Mr. Dana and the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick&rdquo; Dana, as he is called, and Miss Dockery are probably in their late
sixties.</p>
<p>Dick is the son of the late Charles B. Dana, an Episcopal clergyman, and
Elvira R. Dana. The Rev. Dr. Dana was from Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Richard was given a splendid education. He was a pianist of exceptional
ability. As years passed he spent much of his fortune, living a great part of the
time in the East. When he returned to Glenwood, he seemed to live the life of a
hermit, living alone with his piano and his music. Gradually gray locks reached
his shoulders, and long whiskers covered his face.</p>
<p>County officials decided it would be best to appoint a guardian for him and
Miss Dockery was named. The Dana and Dockery families had been friends for
generations. Miss Dockery, who was alone and growing old, was glad to accept the
charge of her old friend.</p>
<p>A few years ago there was a murder in the neighborhood. There had been
some trouble between the murdered woman and the Dockery-Dana people because
of trespassing goats. The two recluses were accused of the murder. They were
taken into court, held in prison, stood trial, and finally were declared &ldquo;not
guilty&rdquo;. Dana proved that at the time of the murder he was playing the piano
and was not near the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>During the period of their incarceration, vandals ransacked &ldquo;Goat Castle&rdquo;
and carried away many valuable relics. A guard was finally placed over the place
to prevent souvenir hunters from taking the remainder of the valuable pieces.
Public sympathy was aroused, and for a short time Dana and Miss Dockery were
lionized. They seemed to take a new lease on life. They improved in personal
appearance. They often came to town, but conditions in &ldquo;Goat Castle&rdquo; changed
little.</p>
<p>Goats roam the place in undisturbed joy. Chickens roost on the foot of the
great mahogany bed while Dick plays his old piano for curious tourists who pay
twenty-five cents to see the old aristocrat, and Miss Dockery tells stories of
the former wealth and prestige of her friend, who desired to withdraw from the
world.</p>
<p>Glenwood is falling. Neglect and age are causing decay. The stables and outhouses
are piles of mortar and decayed timbers, though the grounds are still
beautiful with majestic moss-draped oaks and flowering magnolias.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig52">
<img src="images/p27.jpg" alt="Gloucester" width="800" height="585" />
</div>
<p>A mile drive from the city limits of Natchez, along a roadway where moss-draped
boughs overlap into a verdant shelter, brings one in view of a stately red
brick mansion. It is Gloucester. Still half concealed by giant oaks and tropical
growth, it seems a great ruby in a gray-gold setting.</p>
<p>Gloucester is surrounded by 250 acres of farm land and virgin timber. It was
built about 1800, and is of solid brick construction. Huge Corinthian columns
support spacious galleries across the broad front. The windows are iron barred
and shuttered.</p>
<p>This mansion is of historic interest. It was the home of Governor Winthrop
Sargent, who was the first Governor of Mississippi Territory.</p>
<p>Front twin doorways are an unusual feature. Inside these doors are the heavy
wooden bars, the original fastenings against unfriendly Indian tribes and traveling
bandits, who were not infrequent during the early days of life at Gloucester.</p>
<p>The twin doors open into a wide hallway which contains a graceful curving
stairway leading to hall and bedrooms above.</p>
<p>Gloucester has a splendid library of rare first editions and valuable old books.
The drawing room contains Colonial furniture and paintings by masters.</p>
<p>Upon the death of Governor Sargent, Gloucester became the property of his
wife, who, in turn, willed it to her son, George Washington Sargent.</p>
<p>During the occupation of Natchez by Federal troops, the young Sargent was
called to the doorway of Gloucester, and shot by two soldiers to whom he had
given greeting. Stains of the life-blood of this George Washington Sargent are
still visible on the doorway of Gloucester. The murdered boy was buried beside
his father in the family burial ground across the road from the home.</p>

<p>In the Negro quarters there are weird tales of ghosts wandering over the
premises. &ldquo;Two tall ghosts, in uniform, carrying guns, come on dark rainy nights
when the owls hoot in the oaks above the graves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Records show that in 1877 Gloucester was sold to James Surget, who was one
of Natchez&rsquo; earliest and most affluent citizens. This home was continuously owned
by the Surget family for sixty years, until the recent death of Mrs. Katherine Boyd
Surget, when the property was bequeathed to its present owner, Lenox Stanton.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Stanton hold dear every Gloucester tradition and take pride in
maintaining the home and grounds in their original state of perfection.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig54">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="Hawthorne" width="800" height="606" />
</div>
<p>On the famous Natchez Trace Highway, within calling distance of the Lower
Woodville road, through a narrow gateway flanked by giant oaks, is a quaint
little cottage, &ldquo;Hawthorne&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is the old Southern Planter type home, a story-and-a-half.</p>
<p>A beautiful double front door with panels of early period thin glass and an
exquisitely wrought fanlight above give an atmosphere of friendliness to the
entrance.</p>
<p>Architects interested in the unusual find charm in the hand-hewn stairway
which rises from the broad back hall to the rooms above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawthorne&rdquo; more than a century ago belonged to a family named Overaker
who sold the place with its sixty acres of wooded land to the Dunbar family,
under whose regime this quaint old home sheltered and entertained the elite of
the South as early as 1837. It is believed that Hawthorne was built by the Tichenor
family about 1825.</p>
<p>For many years this old place was vacant. Lumber mills and grist mills crowded
too near, but the property was recently bought by the family of William McGehee,
who are reclaiming &ldquo;Hawthorne&rdquo;. Every line of the period architecture is being
followed, and &ldquo;Hawthorne&rdquo;, its meadows and gardens, will soon be restored as in
stage coach days to greet today its motor car visitors. The history of Hawthorne
is a sad story with a hopeful ending.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c28"><i>Hope Farm</i></h2>
<p>A few years ago when &ldquo;Hope Farm&rdquo; fell into the hands of Mr. and Mrs.
Balfour Miller it was truly &ldquo;getting a break&rdquo; for rehabilitation. Today when one
steps into this old Spanish house, built about 1775, there breathes from every
crevice and corner the true atmosphere of the Old South.</p>
<p>The original portion of Hope Farm, its English wing, is believed to have
been built by Marcus Haller. The front, the straight, low, Spanish portion, was
built by the Spanish Governor, de Grand Pre, about the year 1790.</p>
<p>The low sweeping roof extending over a broad portico across the entire front
of the house is upheld by seven hand-hewn cypress columns. Broad steps lead
from the driveway to the terraced yard. This yard is a veritable bouquet of old-fashioned
small flowers, bordered by boxwood and flanked by syringa, japonica,
and other old-fashioned evergreen shrubs. A radiant variety of orchid-like irises
dot the entire approach to the old brick steps of the terrace.</p>
<p>For ninety years Hope Farm belonged to the Montgomery family; of the last
generation of ten children (seven girls and three boys) two of the sisters lived in
spinsterhood at Hope Farm until within the last few years when the property was
acquired by the Millers.</p>
<p>Restoration of exterior and interior has been done with exceeding care to
hold every line of the original house. There were no nails in the day when Hope
Farm was built and its timbers are held together by wooden pegs.</p>
<p>The front door leads directly into a huge living room, which opens through
an archway into a large dining room. These two rooms extend across the entire
front.</p>
<p>The welcoming gate of Hope Farm opens at the intersection of Homochitto
street on the drive to Duncan Park.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/p29.jpg" alt="Homewood" width="700" height="656" />
</div>
<p>It required five years to build this palatial mansion of brick, cement, and iron
grill, and until recently &ldquo;Homewood&rdquo;, exterior and interior, was in a perfect
state of preservation&mdash;just as it was the day of its completion, more than 75 years
ago. Homewood was destroyed by fire, January 2, 1940.</p>
<p>By reason of its solid masonry (built to withstand the storms), its architectural
lines, and the grace and magnificence of its iron trimmings, architects of
note from all over the country came to inspect and to study &ldquo;Homewood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One million home-burned brick were used in the main structure. Copper
pipes laid in cement supplied the huge cisterns throughout the years with cold
drinking water. This construction represented the work of hundreds of slaves.
All locks, hinges, and door knobs were of silver. The fluted Ionic columns and
grill work were imported from Spain.</p>
<p>Approaching Homewood by the magnificent forest driveway, it was a wonderfully
imposing structure with a front of thirty-foot columns, an upper balcony of
cast iron grill, and massive double panel entrance doors flanked on either side
by expensive ruby glass which was imported from Belgium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/p29a.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="800" height="498" />
</div>
<p>There were six rooms on the ground floor, connected by huge sliding mahogany
doors, making it possible to open the entire floor into one immense room,
80 feet long. Leading to six rooms and cross halls above was a fan spread stairway.
The top floor was a peculiarly constructed octagonal hall surrounded by eight
large closets or storage rooms with cedar linings.</p>
<p>The mantels in Homewood attracted much attention because of their delicate
beauty and apparent value. In the drawing room the mantel was of white marble,
while in the dining room stood one of pink marble with deep rose tracings.</p>
<p>Homewood had no historic interest but it was an outstanding example of the
advanced architectural ideas of the builders of Southern ante-bellum homes. It
was built for a gift from David Hunt to his daughter, Catherine, and her husband,
William L. Balfour.</p>
<p>The most recent owners, Mr. and Mrs. Kingsly Swan, spared no expense in

<div class="img" id="fig59">
<img src="images/p30.jpg" alt="Inglewood" width="800" height="473" />
</div>
<p>A Southern planter&rsquo;s typical home, &ldquo;Inglewood&rdquo; stands today as the perfection
of a beautiful dream recalled from crumbling ruins of years long gone. More than
a century ago this quaint old story-and-a-half house was built by Gustavus
Calhoun, who practiced medicine in Natchez Territory in 1829&mdash;back in the days
when calls were made on horseback and the doctor carried along his miniature
drug store in his &ldquo;saddle bags&rdquo;. Dr. Calhoun was a friend and contemporary of
Dr. Stephen Duncan of &ldquo;Auburn&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In 1858 &ldquo;Inglewood&rdquo; became the home of Edward M. Blackburn through his
marriage into the Calhoun family. It has been for many years known as &ldquo;the old
Blackburn place.&rdquo; Here the last member of the Natchez Blackburn family lived
until the old house was about to tumble down. Then the place was purchased by
Dr. Wallace Smith, a young physician who came with his bride to reclaim and
rebuild Inglewood along the exact lines of its original architectural design.</p>
<p>The old gardens of Inglewood were once as famous for beauty as those of
&ldquo;Arlington&rdquo; and &ldquo;Melrose&rdquo; but the gardens too passed with the old families.
Doctor and Mrs. Smith are replanting, and are replacing walks and borders of
old-fashioned boxwood, everything to conform as nearly as possible to original
design.</p>
<p>Inglewood, like all Natchez homes, is off the highway, secluded by forests, and
only by careful observation can one glimpse the gleaming white outlines of this
beautiful old plantation home.</p>
<p>The approach to the house is marked at the public highway by a wrought iron
replica of the old-fashioned doctor&rsquo;s horse and buggy. Inglewood is today, as
it was originally, the property of a practicing physician&rsquo;s family.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig60">
<img src="images/p30a.jpg" alt="Jefferson College" width="793" height="600" />
</div>
<p>Founded in 1802, Jefferson Military College is the oldest college for boys in
the State of Mississippi, and one of the oldest in the United States.</p>
<p>It was here that the South&rsquo;s beloved Jefferson Davis, who became President
of the Confederacy, attended school when he was ten years old.</p>
<p>After the battle of New Orleans Gen. Andrew Jackson rested his victorious
army on the campus of this college, which is located six miles from the city of
Natchez.</p>
<p>Mississippi was a territory when the college came into existence. On the spot
where the constitution of the State of Mississippi was adopted is a marker commemorating
the birth of Mississippi as a State. The marker was erected May 14,
1935, the 119th anniversary of the State.</p>
<p>Near the front gate of the college there are two giant gnarled liveoaks, known
as the Aaron Burr oaks because they stood in front of the old courthouse where
Aaron Burr was tried for treason against the United States. The old courthouse
was demolished ages ago but the oaks stand sentinel with wide spreading boughs
marking the spot famous in history and in story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c32"><i>King&rsquo;s Tavern</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig61">
<img src="images/p31.jpg" alt="King&rsquo;s Tavern" width="800" height="595" />
</div>
<p>In the days when Indians roamed the territory of Natchez, block houses were
built by the white settlers who came that way. These were sturdy, well-fortified
houses built to protect occupants against Indian outbreaks. Such is King&rsquo;s Tavern&mdash;an
inconspicuous, faded, old wooden structure on a high brick foundation.</p>
<p>Although unostentatious, King&rsquo;s Tavern is important. According to the records
it is the oldest building in this part of the South. Parts of St. Augustine,
Florida, are somewhat older. Its very atmosphere breathes of days and people long
dead; of Indians, of Spanish and English and French noblemen; of weary travelers
over foot paths or by river boats, wandering into the old Tavern, resting,
and then departing, disappearing from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>The house is more than 170 years old. Records show that &ldquo;the first United
States mail brought over the Natchez Trace was delivered to King&rsquo;s Tavern by
an Indian runner and was distributed from this point.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The timbers are held together by wooden pegs and beams. The heavier timbers
are of the type used in the construction of large ships of that period. Ceilings in
the rooms are low. Doors and windows are heavy with narrow frames. The sills
and sleepers of the building show the rope holes, again indicating that timbers
came from old sailing vessels.</p>
<p>The earliest official record of transfer of this property shows 1789 as the year
it was granted to Richard King, a member of the King family of Long Island,
New York, and by him it was given the name &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Tavern&rdquo;. Formerly it had
been known as the Bledsoe House.</p>
<p>For a period of about 115 years the property has been owned and occupied by
the descendants of Mrs. Elizabeth Postlethwaite.</p>
<p>An interesting relic of bygone years is a portrait in oils of the late Samuel
Postlethwaite III, who was Mayor of Natchez in 1825 when the great Lafayette
visited the little village. This portrait is signed by the artist, Benjamin West.</p>
<p>Mrs. A. C. Register and Mrs. Jean Register Modsett, descendants of the
Postlethwaite family, are the present owners and occupants of King&rsquo;s Tavern.</p>
<p><i>Legend:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At night, when all&rsquo;s dark and quiet at King&rsquo;s Tavern, ghosts of Indian
warriors, in full dress of their native tribe, wander through the old Tap
Room, loll and lean against the old bar, peer out through small crevices,
and then disappear through the heavy doors which lead onto the street.</p>

<img src="images/p32.jpg" alt="Lansdown" width="800" height="466" />
</div>
<p>Lansdown has been the home of the Marshall family for more than eighty-five
years. Like many other magnificent plantation homes around Natchez,
Lansdown was a wedding gift to Mr. and Mrs. George Marshall, whose descendants
of the same name own and occupy today this comfortable Georgian type
house.</p>
<p>Lansdown is an unpretentious but quite substantial structure with a broad
front portico enclosed by artistic grill bannisters fashioned in Greek pattern.
Broad, spreading steps lead down to a brick walk, and on each side stand the old
carriage blocks of yesteryear.</p>

</div>
<p>Portraits by famous artists of earlier generations of Marshalls, including a
portrait of Levin R. Marshall by Sully, look down on gorgeous rosewood and
mahogany furnishings of their own selection placed in Lansdown.</p>
<p>The china and silver in this home are the pride of the present generation of
Marshalls. Much of the original china is in use today. Many pieces of the original
Robert E. Lee furnishings of &ldquo;Stratford Hall&rdquo; are now in Lansdown. Within the
past few months the younger generation at Lansdown discovered several pieces
of silver bearing the unmistakable mark of Robert E. Lee.</p>
<p>Lansdown came to the Marshalls through Mrs. Charlotte Hunt Marshall.
Natchez had a great benefactor in David Hunt, the father of Charlotte Hunt
Marshall. It was he who made possible the Chamberlain-Hunt Military Academy
at Port Gibson, Mississippi, one of the first schools for boys in the Southland. It
is still an excellent school for young men.</p>
<p>Today Lansdown is owned and occupied by George Marshall III and Mrs.
Agnes Marshall Ward, lineal descendants of the original owner, who named the
place &ldquo;Lansdown&rdquo; by virtue of his friendship for the celebrated Marquis of
Lansdown, England.</p>

<h2 id="c34"><i>Linden</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig66">
<img src="images/p33.jpg" alt="Entrance" width="689" height="700" />
</div>
<p>The origin of Linden seems lost to history although it is known to have
existed as early as 1790. It came to ancestors of the present owners a hundred
years ago, and has been owned and occupied by the A. M. Feltus family for several
generations.</p>
<p>Nature seems to exert herself to give to Linden a perfect setting. Surrounding
the magnificently constructed house, with its 98 feet of gallery, are dozens of oak
trees, draped in long gray moss which sweeps the very eaves of the dwelling. Standing
in the artistic entrance of Linden one sees the outside world through growing
draperies of swaying gray lace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<div class="img" id="fig67">
<img src="images/p33a.jpg" alt="Linden" width="800" height="478" />
</div>
<p>The architecture of Linden is as unusual as it is simple. The center portion is
two stories, flanked on each side by single-storied rooms. A gallery runs the entire
width of the building. To the rear of the single-storied rooms is a long two-storied
wing. Each wing is a complete apartment.</p>
<p>The furnishings are rare and exquisite, producing a feeling of restfulness
and satisfaction. &ldquo;Linden&rdquo; has three paintings by Audubon, and an interesting
portrait of the song-bird, Jenny Lind.</p>
<p>The driveway through the grounds of Linden leads past the front entrance
entirely around the house and passes its beautifully kept gardens. A circle driveway
which leads out through the bricked entrance affords a final glimpse of the
stately white house in the distance, not unlike &ldquo;Mount Vernon&rdquo;. The view across
the hill brings &ldquo;Monmouth&rdquo;, a neighboring mansion, to the eye as another
delightful prospect.</p>

<h2 id="c35"><i>Greenleaves</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Greenleaves&rdquo;, built prior to 1812, is a town house&mdash;a great rambling cottage
type of architecture in the very heart of Natchez. It is as sturdy as the old gnarled
oaks which seem to hold it in their protecting boughs. It represents comfort,
luxury, and beauty without ostentation or pretense.</p>
<p>The halls and rooms are palatial in size and appointments. The house as
originally constructed shows that it was built to endure. It was remodeled in the
early 40&rsquo;s by the grandfather of the present owners.</p>
<p>A wealth of the original furnishings in solid mahogany and rosewood and
many rare museum pieces have remained in Greenleaves throughout generations,
and are today as beautiful as the day they came from foreign shores.</p>
<p>The present owners, Mr. and Mrs. Melchoir Beltzhoover, the third generation
of the Koontz family to occupy Greenleaves, grace this ante-bellum home with
pardonable pride of possession.</p>
<p>The family of the original owners of Greenleaves was wiped out during a
yellow fever epidemic, the entire family filling one grave. Eventually Greenleaves
was bought by George Washington Koontz of Pennsylvania, who became a leading
influence, financially and socially, in Natchez. Children of the present occupants
of Greenleaves are the fourth generation of the Koontz family to enjoy
this luxurious home.</p>
<p>Mr. Beltzhoover&rsquo;s ownership of this property is shared with his sister, Mrs.
Guy Robinson, who is a resident of New York state.</p>
<p><i>Legend:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the giant liveoaks at the rear of Greenleaves the Natchez tribe of
Indians held their annual pow-wows and decided all momentous questions.</p>

<h2 id="c36"><i>Longwood</i></h2>
<p>Longwood stands in a moss-tangled forest. It is a monument to a dream that
was interrupted by the tragedy of the War Between the States in 1861-&rsquo;65. It was
to have been a gorgeous structure of Moorish design, planned by Sloan of Philadelphia,
who in those days had no equal as artist-architect.</p>
<p>Longwood was being built for Dr. Haller Nutt. Landscape gardeners came
from abroad, and even today rare imported shrubs and trees form a part of the
dense growth around the unfinished gardens.</p>
<p>When the house reached its present point of construction, with more than a
hundred thousand dollars already invested, there came the cry of war and the
call to arms. Workmen laid down their tools and took their guns and never
returned to the task of completing Longwood.</p>
<p>The deep concrete foundation, the outside framework, and some of the trimmings
of the house were well under way. Today there are huge sections of carved
moulding, old paint buckets and brushes, tool boxes, and carpenter&rsquo;s implements
scattered about the upper floors&mdash;just as they were left almost 75 years ago.</p>
<p>The house, begun in the late 50&rsquo;s, is of brick, burned by slaves on the place,
with columns and grill work of hand-carved, time-enduring cypress. The ground
floor contained a nursery and an adjoining apartment for a white housekeeper
and governess, a card room, a billiard room, wine cellar, and heating plant. This
floor is the only part of the building that reached anything like completion. The
upper floors were boarded up. All orders for materials, marble stairway, mosaic
floors, and elaborate furnishings were canceled. Many of these orders had been
placed in Italy and France. Some costly pieces were en route on the high seas.
A few items were returned and others are now in national museums.</p>
<p>Dr. Nutt died in 1864, survived by his wife and a large family of children.
One of the descendants of these children now occupies the finished lower floor
or basement of Longwood. There is on this floor a huge rotunda and eight large
rooms, surrounded by a moat. Many relics of past generations adorn these quarters,
including antiques from different branches of the family.</p>
<p>There are several pieces of richly carved rosewood furniture, an exquisite old
grand piano, and oil portraits of Dr. Nutt and his beautiful blonde wife by
famous old-world artists.</p>
<p>James and Merritt Ward of Natchez and Mrs. Julia Ward Blanchard of New
York City are the present owners of Longwood.</p>
<p>Planned as a palatial home for a family of eleven children and eight hundred
slaves, today Longwood (often referred to as &ldquo;Nutt&rsquo;s Folly&rdquo;) is occupied by
Merritt Ward and one servant.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig72">
<img src="images/p36.jpg" alt="Magnolia Vale" width="800" height="463" />
</div>
<p>A few hundred feet below the city of Natchez, along the river edge, is an
extension of land on which the first Natchez was situated. This old town was
known as &ldquo;Natchez Under the Hill&rdquo;. The commercial center of the old Natchez
has passed into decay. The buildings that sheltered the river men, the gambling
&ldquo;joints&rdquo; that housed the riff-raff of those steamboat days, have long since tumbled
into the river. Driving down a long and steep shelf of land, at the north end of
what was old Natchez, one comes to the gate of a castle-like home in the heart
of a garden which is always beautiful with blossoms. It is &ldquo;Magnolia Vale&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This house was built about 110 years ago by Andrew Brown and is owned
today by Andrew B. Learned, a direct descendant.</p>
<p>Andrew Brown was a native of Scotland, and a great lover of flowers. After
building a home of the early American type, with wide galleries, handsome Doric
columns, spacious halls and large rooms, he found self-expression in creating a
garden which has been famous for generations, from St. Louis to New Orleans, as
&ldquo;Brown&rsquo;s Gardens&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A formal driveway, bordered with Louis Philippe roses, leads to the mansion.
Giant magnolias and evergreen laurimundi splash the landscape with white and
green. Formal flower beds, with boxwood borders, cover the entire acreage of
the foreground to Magnolia Vale.</p>
<p>The Mississippi River has continuously eaten into the grounds of Magnolia
Vale until much of this promontory has vanished into the waters. Although the
great house shows marked evidence of &ldquo;settling&rdquo; from year to year, and is occupied
now by a caretaker only, the gardens are given constant attention. The same
trim boxwood hedges, the same formal walks and beloved flower beds, the same
shrubs, the same tall trees, and the maze of gardenia and japonica greet the
visitor and shed perfume across the broad and mighty river, which ravenously
eats at the very roots of these gorgeous plants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c38"><i>Mount Repose</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig73">
<img src="images/p36a.jpg" alt="Mount Repose" width="800" height="383" />
</div>
<p>Here is a huge, comfortable, old-fashioned, country gentleman&rsquo;s home&mdash;in
appearance and in literal fact &ldquo;Mount Repose&rdquo;. The name aptly describes the
first impression of every visitor.</p>
<p>The house is situated on an elevation, surrounded by broad green acres.</p>
<p>Built in the early 1800&rsquo;s, Mount Repose has been the scene of much that is
interesting in the story of Natchez. It is part of the original estate of William
Bisland, a Scotsman. From this family comes the author Elizabeth Bisland who
through close association with Lafcadio Hearn, when both of them worked for the
old New Orleans <i>Picayune</i>, was able to write the interesting life of that genius.
This book and many others by Elizabeth Bisland, including <i>Candle of Understanding</i>
and <i>The Case of John Smith</i>, can be found in public libraries today.</p>
<p>The present owners of Mount Repose, Mr. and Mrs. A. R. Baldwin of New
York, are direct descendants of the Bisland family. Its present occupants, the
J. D. Shields family are also descendants of the Bislands. Mrs. Shields is a
descendant of the renowned English beauty, Margaret Watts, who married the
Spanish Governor, Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, who is prominently identified with
Natchez&rsquo; earliest history.</p>
<p>The original furnishings of Mount Repose have gone out to Bisland heirs,
and yet valuable antiques and family portraits remain in the old house.</p>
<p>An interesting story is told of a wager expressive of the loyalty of William
Bisland to Henry Clay.</p>
<p>Mr. Bisland believed that Henry Clay should be, and would be, the next
president of the United States. He laid a wager in accordance with his belief.
He had just planted a formal line of sentinel trees along a driveway to the main
entrance of Mount Repose. He openly declared that this driveway would be
closed until Clay was elected. He then proceeded with great preparations for its
formal opening, but history tells why today there grow two long lines of well-spaced
trees from the big front gate to the house&mdash;that gate unopened through
the years! The entrance to Mount Repose is through the side gate. Henry Clay
was never elected president.</p>

<h2 id="c39"><i>Melmont</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig74">
<img src="images/p37.jpg" alt="Melmont" width="800" height="626" />
</div>
<p>&rsquo;Way back in 1839, when Henry Basil Shaw married Mary Elizabeth Lattimore,
profound consideration was given to naming the homes and estates of Natchez. It
is almost certain that the mistress of Melmont pondered long and consulted her
family before deciding the name. She chose to use the three initials of Mary
Elizabeth Lattimore to form the first part of the name, &ldquo;Mel&rdquo;, and added &ldquo;mont&rdquo;
because the mansion stood mounted on a rolling acreage. Thus &ldquo;Melmont&rdquo;
was coined.</p>
<p>Melmont is unlike other Natchez homes. The architecture is its own peculiar
type. A sturdy, well-built house, it has for almost a century cared for Natchez&rsquo;
foremost citizens and their illustrious guests. Claiborne, the historian, Judge
Samuel Brooks, and other prominent men spent much time at Melmont.</p>
<p>The acreage around Melmont has been sold and modern homes have been
built on the land. Melmont is now a palatial town house, no longer a
country home.</p>
<p>Melmont was within the Federal lines during the War Between the States.
When Natchez was shelled from the river in 1862 shells fell in the yard and gardens
and destroyed giant oak trees and landscaping.</p>
<p>The interior decoration and furnishing are to a great extent from the original
family although many handsome pieces have been added by subsequent owners.
Mrs. John Ayres and her sister, Miss Corinne Henderson, have occupied this
home for many years. Mrs. Ayers especially prizes a mahogany bureau which has
chests on either side for storing wigs.</p>

<p>A valuable Hepplewhite desk in the drawing room attracts much interest. It

have written an appeal to Congress in 1798 &ldquo;for schools for the education of
children and provision for regular ministry of the Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melmont is well preserved, exterior and interior, and holds great charm for
all who come within its portals.</p>

<p>Melrose, called &ldquo;the perfect ante-bellum home&rdquo;, is located about a mile from
Natchez city limits. This model mansion, built in the early 40&rsquo;s, owned and
occupied by Mr. and Mrs. George M. D. Kelly, is, by courtesy of the owners,
opened for inspection during the annual Pilgrimage celebration of the Natchez
Garden Club. In an entire day one can only glimpse Melrose and its treasures.
Another full day could be well spent in the surrounding woodlands and boxwood
bordered gardens.</p>
<p>Built in 1845 by Judge Edward Turner for his daughter, Mrs. McMurran, it
was purchased immediately after the War Between the States by George Malin
Davis, grandfather of the present owner, George Malin Davis Kelly. Mr. Kelly
has with great pride of possession kept the Melrose home and estate in its original

<p>The approach to Melrose is through acres of lawn as smooth as stretched
velvet. The house is an imposing brick building of the square Georgian architectural
design, with upper and lower porticos, and supporting Ionic columns.</p>
<p>The front door is of attractive Colonial style with diamond shaped sidelights.
A broad sweep of steps lead to the wide portico.</p>
<p>A spacious hall runs through the lower floor. It is appropriately furnished in
rare old pieces; among these is an unusual table which is set with semi-precious
stones, and an ancient grandfather&rsquo;s clock. The lighting for this grand hallway is
provided by numerous rows of candles, held in dainty but substantial frames.
The floor covering (which is the original) attracts immediate attention by reason
of its beauty, unique design, and quality. It can be best described as a striking
inlay of unknown origin.</p>
<p>To the right of the hall is the front drawing room. The rosewood furniture is
Empire style, and is in as perfect condition today as on the day of its purchase.</p>

<p>To the left is a dining room 20 feet square. Black marble mantels add dignity
to the room. A handsome mahogany punka swings over the dining table. This
bespeaks undeniable antiquity. Until quite recently the owners of Melrose cared
for several old slaves who pulled the punka to create breezes for the comfort of
the family during meals.</p>
<p>Melrose still uses its outside brick kitchen, reached by a broad brick walk
from the main house. Above the kitchen are quarters for the house servants.</p>
<p>The upper floors of Melrose contain bedrooms, halls, and a sewing room.
Massive beds so high that occupants must climb in by a set of specially made
mahogany steps; heavy bureaus, armoirs, dressing tables, tilt top tables, and
day bed&mdash;all are heirlooms of the original owners and of the present owners.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis (the grandfather of the present owner) came South from Pennsylvania
many years before the war of &rsquo;61, and was educated at Sewanee College,
Sewanee, Tennessee. His only daughter married Dr. Stephen Kelly of New York,
and that daughter became the mother of George M. D. Kelly, the present owner
of Melrose mansion.</p>
<p>George M. D. Kelly and his wife, who was Miss Ethel Moore, are members of

<h2 id="c41"><i>Monmouth</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig81">
<img src="images/p40.jpg" alt="Monmouth" width="800" height="547" />
</div>
<p>Near &ldquo;Linden&rdquo;, on a velvety lawn guarded by great oaks, stands a Grecian-type
mansion. This is Monmouth, now owned and maintained by Mrs. Hubert
Barnum. Mrs. Barnum, owner of &ldquo;Arlington&rdquo;, the adjoining estate, is probably
the only Natchezian who owns and operates two great ante-bellum homes.</p>
<p>Historically Monmouth is known as the home of John A. Quitman and his
wife, Eliza. General Quitman, a hero of national renown, raised the first American
flag in Mexico. He purchased this mansion and fifteen surrounding acres about
the year 1826.</p>
<p>Edith Wyatt Moore in her story of Monmouth says: &ldquo;John A. Quitman and
Eliza Turner drew a marriage contract prior to their wedding. He relinquished
all right of inheritance to her property in case of her death without children.
He gave her the right to handle slaves and property or dispose of same without
his consent.&rdquo; General Quitman was a native of New York.</p>
<p>A man of great popularity and military distinction, General Quitman&rsquo;s home
became the scene of many gatherings of the notables of America. Monmouth was
classed among the most perfectly appointed homes of its day.</p>
<p>General Quitman died in 1859 from what was suspected as the effect of slow
poison administered at a banquet given in honor of President Buchanan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>For a period following General Quitman&rsquo;s death his beloved Monmouth was
vacant. It became dilapidated from disuse, and after passing through many
hands was purchased by Mrs. Annie Gwynne, who is now Mrs. Barnum. Every
part has been repaired or renewed and the old mansion stands today in majestic
perfection.</p>
<p>Great square pillars support the upper portico, which is encircled by attractive
lattice grill work. The walls are of brick. The doors, with fan transoms and
side-lights, and the window frames are made of hand-carved wood. Spacious halls,
huge rooms with high ceilings, and a pervading air of solid, substantial structure
make Monmouth a monument eternal to a man whose memory shall never die&mdash;a
man of whom it was said, &ldquo;He is Mississippi&rsquo;s best-loved citizen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The original furnishings of Monmouth are long since gone. These were supplanted
by rare antiques from the superb collection of Mrs. Barnum&rsquo;s family, the
Greens, who founded Greensboro, North Carolina.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig83">
<img src="images/p41.jpg" alt="Monteigne" width="800" height="526" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Monteigne&rdquo; is a recently acquired possession of one of Natchez&rsquo; most valued
families, Mrs. Mary Worrell Kendall and Mr. and Mrs. William Kendall. It was
built in 1855 as the home of Gen. William T. Martin of the Confederacy, whose
features are carved on Stone Mountain as a representative of the State of Mississippi.
Hand-hewn timbers discovered when excavating the foundation for
&ldquo;Monteigne&rdquo; lead to the belief that this was the site of a home destroyed during
the Indian Massacre of 1729.</p>
<p>The place bears the French Huguenot name for Martin, &ldquo;Monteigne&rdquo;. It is
unlike any of the old homes around Natchez. Predominantly Georgian in appearance,
Monteigne stands out distinctively. A solid, two-story structure, built of
sturdiest timbers, this home has withstood the ravages of time and the desecration
of opposing forces during the War Between the States.</p>
<p>It is said that horses were &ldquo;stalled&rdquo; in the parlors by Yankee soldiers, rosewood
furniture used for kindling fires, and valuable silver and brass melted and lost.</p>

</div></div>
<p>Upon his return from the war, General Martin saw the destruction of the
beauty of his house and its grounds. With the undismayed courage of a great man
who knows how to overcome defeat, he began the restoration of his home and its
eleven acres of yard and gardens.</p>
<p>When Leslie Carpenter bought Monteigne in 1928 Natchez was assured
another perfect estate. Terraced lawns and rose gardens were brought to life;
driveways, trellises, shrubbery, and flagged walks were restored to this classic
home.</p>
<p>The interior of Monteigne is stately&mdash;formal and yet inviting&mdash;with the
black and white mosaic floor in its great entrance hall.</p>
<p>Monteigne recently passed from the Carpenters to the present owners, Mrs.
Mary Worrell Kendall, her son, William, and his wife and their two little
daughters.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig87">
<img src="images/p42b.jpg" alt="Myrtle Terrace" width="800" height="590" />
</div>
<p>Substantial and compact, this Colonial cottage is one of the reclaimed small
ante-bellum homes of Natchez. Built in the 1830&rsquo;s, it is more than a century old.</p>
<p>In 1844 Myrtle Terrace was purchased by the late L. N. Carpenter, who, in
turn, sold it to the renowned Captain Thomas Leathers of steamboat fame. The
agreement to buy stipulated in minute detail that the property must be put in
&ldquo;ship shape&rdquo;, carefully specifying &ldquo;hinges on the windows, fastenings on the
cellar door, latches on the gates, blinds on all windows except the dormers,
building a stable and a carriage house&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Captain Leathers was identified with the famous <i>Natchez-Robert E. Lee</i> steamboat
race from New Orleans to St. Louis, on the Mississippi river, in 1870. The
prize was $20,000. The race has become an epic. So thrilling is it in the history of
river traffic it was dramatized in a recent celebration on the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>Captain Leathers of the <i>Natchez</i> lost the race to Captain Cannon of the
<i>Robert E. Lee</i> not because he had a slower boat but because of his over-confidence.
He traveled nonchalantly and made all his regular stops. In the pinch he would
not jeopardize the safely of his passengers by pressing his boilers beyond the
safety point.</p>
<p>Captain Leathers lived in Myrtle Terrace for many years, and the place is still
known as the &ldquo;home of the Captain of the steamboat <i>Natchez</i>&rdquo;. It is now owned
and occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Dan Tucker, who have reclaimed the old lines of
the house and have added modern interior improvements.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig88">
<img src="images/p43.jpg" alt="Propinquity" width="800" height="524" />
</div>
<p>In the long ago, when each Southern plantation was identified by a specially
chosen name, the naming of homes around Natchez was a great event. When land
was opened and a home built, a recorded name was given, and neither time nor
change of owner or occupant changed the name of that plantation. Interesting
indeed are the stories of the names selected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Propinquity&rdquo; was named in 1810 by its owner, Brigadier General Leonard
Covington, and was so named because its lands adjoined Fort Dearborn where he
was in command of a troop of Light Dragoons. Today Propinquity is appropriate
as &ldquo;near to nature&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The plantation belonged originally to one William Belk. The records shows
that in 1797 a committee met at this place for the purpose of appointing a Public
Safety organization, the first American political assembly held in the Lower Mississippi
Valley.</p>
<p>For several generations Propinquity has been owned by the descendants of
Jane Long, the famous &ldquo;Mother of Texas&rdquo;, who spent many happy days in this
quaint old home. It is still a reliquary for interesting possessions of the Texas
heroine.</p>
<p>Situated on a side road off the original &ldquo;Natchez Trace&rdquo;, this old house is
built on simple early American lines. A wide center hall with a deep mahogany
stairway runs the length of the two huge rooms on either side. Green shuttered,
small pane windows, a solid three-panel front door with straight glass sidelights,
and a small upper and lower portico complete the simple picture of this old home.</p>
<p>The furnishings are of the original purchase. There is a tiny melodeon in
the parlor. Its quaint type indicates very early &ldquo;vintage&rdquo;&mdash;a rare museum piece.</p>

<p>Bedrooms where rested the nobility of the land in earlier days are still prim
and precise with poster beds in their original draperies, mahogany armoirs,
bureaus with numerous side compartments and many mirrors to please the fancy
of milady of the early fifties.</p>
<p>In the dining room there is an exquisite set of china, and despite the fact that
it has been in daily use for more than one hundred years, only two small pieces
are missing from the set of 200 pieces. This gives an idea of the order and system,
and the appreciation for the valuable and beautiful at Propinquity.</p>
<p>The house is occupied by Miss Rebecca Miller and Mrs. M. E. Fauntleroy,
who are descendants of the renowned Jane Long.</p>

<img src="images/p44b.jpg" alt="Ravenna" width="800" height="572" />
</div>
<p>At the end of Union street, on ten acres of ground which edges a great ravine
or bayou, stands Ravenna, the present home of Mrs. Richard I. Metcalf.</p>
<p>Ravenna was built more than one hundred years ago by the Harris family.
It has stood the test of time and of the tornado of 1840. It stands today in the
superior dignity of perfection. The property was acquired by the family of its
present owner about eighty years ago.</p>
<p>Ravenna shows every evidence of an inherited love of flowers. This comes
from Andrew Brown of &ldquo;Brown&rsquo;s Gardens&rdquo;, and Mrs. Metcalf, a direct descendant,
has expressed that inherited taste and talent in the beautification of Ravenna.</p>
<p>The house is the large Colonial type. An outstanding feature of the interior
is an exquisite stairway and a great assembly of unusual, massive antiques.</p>
<p>The charm of Ravenna is its setting. Facing a great ravine, the old home
is surrounded by flowers. A huge wisteria vine covers the front of the house with
purple blossoms. The side of the place toward the town is enclosed by a high iron
fence of massive design. The main entrance is through heavy iron gates that lead
along the winding tulip bordered driveway to the front portico. Bordering this
driveway are radiant azalea bushes and japonicas, while at certain seasons of the
year the deep pink of flowering peach trees and almond trees give vivid color
splotches which intensify the beauty of these grounds.</p>
<p>A point of interesting antiquity at Ravenna is the name &ldquo;Caroline Harris&rdquo;
scratched with a diamond into a window pane. This proves conclusively that the
windows were there in 1840 when the Harrises owned Ravenna.</p>

<p>During the War Between the States the peace of Ravenna was greatly disturbed
by Federal soldiers who ordered the Metcalfs to leave this home. Mrs.
Metcalf was suspected of communicating with the Confederate soldiers through
the bayou.</p>
<p>Alter the war Ravenna was reclaimed and again occupied by the Metcalf
family.</p>

stands on the Ravenna grounds, as does also a palatial residence occupied by
Mrs. Roan Fleming Byrnes, who is a leading spirit in promoting the great Natchez
Trace highway project.</p>
<p>This group of family homes, under the sheltering eaves of the parent home,
Ravenna, eloquently bespeaks that close and lovable family life of the South as
it has existed for generations.</p>

<h2 id="c46"><i>Oakland</i></h2>
<p>Among the numerous ante-bellum homes of Natchez which are today owned
and occupied by lineal descendants of the original owners &ldquo;Oakland&rdquo; stands
preeminent. Built in 1838 for Catherine Chotard Eustis, the granddaughter of
Major Stephen Minor, this home remains in the possession of the Minor family.
The present owner is Mrs. Jeanne Minor McDowell. Major Minor was the last
Governor of the Natchez District under Spanish rule.</p>
<p>Oakland is located in secluded grounds, and, as its name implies, stands in
a land of oaks.</p>
<p>The house is a substantial brick building with a wide front portico and broad
brick steps. The spacious center hallway opens with heavy mahogany entrance
doors into an old-fashioned parlor on the right and a large dining room on the
left. The walls are covered with the original paper.</p>
<p>Many pieces of the original furnishings remain. Several rare pieces were
brought to Oakland from &ldquo;Concord&rdquo;, which was the Governor&rsquo;s official mansion
and was destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>The Minors were lovers of race horses, and valuable paintings of beautiful
horses owned by the family adorn the walls. Two especially fine horse pictures
are by Troye. Many silver trophies of racing victories form an interesting part
of Oakland possessions.</p>
<p>In this house is a bed of unique type, known as &ldquo;a family bed&rdquo;. It is a huge
four-poster with silken tester. As broad as it is long, there is plenty of room for
six persons to sleep comfortably!</p>
<p>Ante-bellum gardens wherein grow verbena, gardenia, and sweet olive, with
clipped boxwood borders, complete the handsome setting of Oakland.</p>

<h2 id="c47"><i>Richmond</i></h2>
<p>Life at Richmond today seems a continuous house party. The present owners
(seven daughters, one son, and one granddaughter of the late Shelby Marshall)
are the fifth and sixth generations of the illustrious Levin R. Marshall family to
own and occupy this old and hospitable mansion. It contains 41 rooms.</p>
<p>The architecture of Richmond shows three distinct styles. The original center
building, 153 years old, is of Spanish design; the front, 105 years old, is of Greek
design; and 77 years ago the square English portion of the house was built.</p>
<p>The Spanish part, constructed of sturdy hand-hewn timbers, brick, and
cement, is in an excellent state of preservation. It has stood without reconstruction
throughout the years. There is a cement patio on the ground level, and cypress
steps with artistic iron grill rails reach the main floor from the outside. Here one
can sound the door knocker, and soon hear heavy wooden bars being lifted. This
was the security against Indians and other intruders of early days, and such protection
remains intact at Richmond.</p>
<p>In 1832 Richmond became the property of Levin R. Marshall, great-great-grandfather
of the present owners, and it was he who added the lovely Greek
portion. This addition contains six large rooms on the main floor and four in
the basement.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years later, in order to accommodate a rapidly growing family
and numbers of guests, the red brick English addition was built in the rear.</p>
<p>The main entrance has a front portion with classic Corinthian columns supporting
the roof. A broad hall, the length of two twenty-foot rooms, runs through
the center to a formal dining room. This formal room opens with four tall folding
doors into a smaller family dining room. There are double drawing rooms on the
left side of the great hall.</p>
<p>The massive old furniture remains today in Richmond, as does the family
silver, which is the most ornate and beautiful silver service in the entire South.</p>
<p>The front drawing room harbors a greatly prized relic of the past&mdash;the quaint
concert grand piano which was used to accompany the famous song-bird Jenny
Lind when, under the management of that superb showman, P. T. Barnum, she
toured the South. A beautiful portrait of Jenny Lind hangs near the old piano.</p>
<p>Richmond contains a rich treasure store of old laces, quaint costumes, and
queer candelabra. Quite recently there was discovered an assortment of pans and
plumber&rsquo;s equipment. When assembled this &ldquo;find&rdquo; proved to be a bathtub of
probably the 1850 model. The fastidious bather stood in a tin basin, pulled a
curtain for privacy, while a slave by means of a small hand pump pumped water
from a two-gallon tank overhead; this water ran over the bather, down into the
basin, and was, in turn, pumped up and the bather reshowered.</p>
<p>Fortunes have been made and lost by Richmond owners. The generosity of
Levin R. Marshall extended to the State of Texas and the town of Marshall, in
Texas, is named in honor of this family.</p>

</div>
<p>In the Natchez country &ldquo;Rosalie&rdquo; is a magic name. It conjures up memories of
startling days that were, and stimulates the imagination to see Indians and soldiers
and people from foreign lands.</p>
<p>The home, &ldquo;Rosalie&rdquo;, bears the name and is situated near the site of Fort
Rosalie, which was built by the French in the early 1700&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>No home in Natchez is of greater historical importance than Rosalie. The
building was started about 1820 by Peter B. Little, and required seven years for
completion. All materials are of the choicest selection. Home-burned bricks and
hand-hewn timbers were used in its construction.</p>
<p>Rosalie is situated 200 feet above the Mississippi River. It is now the home of
Miss Rebecca Rumble and Mrs. James Marsh. It contains many original pieces
of furniture, carpets, and exquisite chandeliers. A valuable piece is the mahogany
table at which Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, and U. S. Grant
dined.</p>
<p>Mr. Little married his thirteen-year-old ward, and sent her to Baltimore to
be educated. It was while she was in school that he built this mansion in which
to receive her when she returned.</p>
<p>It is believed that the ground immediately back of Rosalie is the site of the
great Indian massacre of the French in 1729.</p>
<p>Railroad tracks and driveways have cut through the acres that were originally
Rosalie private grounds, but the yard and gardens of the old home are well kept
and are filled with old-fashioned flowers and shrubbery of days long gone.</p>
<p>Rosalie was General Grant&rsquo;s headquarters during the Federal occupation of
Natchez in the War Between the States.</p>
<p>The present occupants display with much pride the huge four-poster mahogany
bed in which General Grant slept during his stay at this old house.</p>
<p>Rosalie has been purchased by the Daughters of the American Revolution,
and will be maintained as a public shrine. Many of the encroaching industrial
buildings will soon give way to the original acreage that formed the gardens of
Rosalie.</p>

</div>
<p>Under the very eaves of old &ldquo;Rosalie&rdquo; with its historic background of Fort
Rosalie, stands a sturdy square structure known as &ldquo;The Parsonage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is a brick building with an English basement, the entrance leading by
broad steps to the elevated first floor.</p>
<p>While of no particular historic interest, The Parsonage has its story.</p>
<p>It was built by Peter Little, the owner and builder of Rosalie, and bears the
same evidence of sturdy construction exemplified in the larger home.</p>
<p>Like most men, Mr. Little wanted the privacy of his own home, while Mrs.
Little, due to religious enthusiasm, felt called upon to entertain every preacher
and his family who passed that way. By reason of this devotion to religious duty,
&ldquo;Rosalie&rdquo; was kept filled with ministerial guests.</p>
<p>Following a long siege of such guests Mr. Little declared to his wife, &ldquo;I am
going to build a home for your church friends and their families&rdquo;. True to this
decision he built a lovely home, and in November 1850 deeded it to the Methodist
Church and called it &ldquo;The Parsonage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After the death of his young wife Mr. Little lived on at Rosalie, a brokenhearted,
lonely old man, until, tradition tells, while ill and alone, in the dark
hours of night, the master of Rosalie and builder of The Parsonage which he
designed to insure his seclusion, was murdered by one of his own slaves.</p>
<p>Later The Parsonage was sold. Today, with its exquisite antique furnishings,
it is the property of the Orrick Metcalfs, who are descendants of one of Natchez&rsquo;
oldest and most respected families.</p>

<h2 id="c50"><i>Stanton Hall</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig106">
<img src="images/p50.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="796" height="591" />
</div>
<p>In the heart of the city of Natchez stands an imposing mansion, &ldquo;Stanton
Hall&rdquo;. It is surrounded by a half-acre of rolling lawn which is enclosed by an
iron fence. This strong iron fence is in a delicate design and is itself worth a
small fortune.</p>
<p>Stanton Hall is the most handsome old home, and probably the most expensive,
in the entire Natchez area. It is not of great historical value but it well
represents the architectural grandeur of the Old South.</p>
<p>It was built during the 1851-56 period. As the building materials were imported,
the house required several years for its construction.</p>
<p>On the first floor there are four tremendous rooms and a broad hall. Hand
carvings for doors and windows, Carrara marble mantels, silver and bronze hinges,
bronze chandeliers, and exquisite over-size mirrors required a specially chartered
ship for their delivery to complete this handsome home. It was built for Frederick
Stanton of Belfast, Ireland, and his young wife, Hulda Helm Stanton, a lady of
the Natchez neighborhood.</p>
<p>The spacious grounds resemble a well-kept park. Aged oaks spread their
moss-draped boughs in a latticed shield, as it were, across the front where white
Corinthian columns support the massive portico which is outlined by iron grill
railings of intricate lacy pattern.</p>
<p>To the right of the entrance is a large drawing room, and back of this, through
an elaborate archway, is a very unusual music room. This room is decorated with
murals of musical instruments on which appear the names of the great old music
masters.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig107">
<img src="images/p50a.jpg" alt="Stanton Hall" width="694" height="800" />
</div>
<p>Woodwork and doors on the first floor are of solid mahogany, with silver
hinges and silver door knobs.</p>
<p>After Stanton Hall passed from the original owners in the year 1894, it was
used as a select school, known as &ldquo;Stanton College for Young Ladies&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In August 1920 Robert T. Clarke bought Stanton Hall and has occupied it
since that date. He recently sold the property to the Pilgrimage Garden Club.</p>

<h2 id="c51"><i>Weymouth Hall</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig108">
<img src="images/p51.jpg" alt="Weymouth Hall" width="800" height="532" />
</div>
<p>Unusual and peculiar is the construction of Weymouth Hall. It was purchased
by Col. John Weymouth in 1821 and was rebuilt in 1852 by the Bullock family.
It is a three-story brick building overlooking the Mississippi River, and has for
its back view acres of Natchez cemetery.</p>
<p>The upper stories are reached by a winding stairway. The third floor is a
ballroom. During the War Between the States this room was used as headquarters
for Union soldiers because it gave a perfect view of the river and surrounding
country.</p>
<p>Stark Young in <i>So Red the Rose</i> refers to Weymouth Hall and the death of
Mrs. John Weymouth in the room below the Union headquarters. He gives a
vivid description of the agony of the family as they watched a loved one slip
away forever amid the hostile booming of drums above her bedroom.</p>
<p>The furnishings, woodwork, and mantels in Weymouth Hall are fascinating
in perfection and antiquity. In the living room on the second floor is a black
marble mantel inlaid with colored roses of mother of pearl. Fabulous offers have
been declined for this mantel. There is probably not another like it in the entire
South.</p>
<p>This old home is now owned and occupied by the Zurhellen and Morton
families, who are lineal descendants of Mrs. John Weymouth.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig109">
<img src="images/p51a.jpg" alt="Ruins of Windsor" width="800" height="640" />
</div>
<p>Twenty-two stone Corinthian columns stand today as remnants of a grand
example of ante-bellum Greek Revival architecture.</p>
<p>Windsor was built in 1861 by S. C. Daniel, a wealthy Mississippi planter who
also had large land holdings in Louisiana. It had five stories, topped by an
observatory. It is said that Mark Twain, when a Mississippi steamboat pilot,
charted his course at this point by the lofty tower of Windsor.</p>
<p>The house and its furnishings were destroyed by fire in 1890.</p>

<h2 id="c53"><i>Windy Hill Manor</i></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig110">
<img src="images/p52.jpg" alt="Windy Hill Manor" width="800" height="572" />
</div>
<p>Nine miles from Natchez, on the Liberty road, in a picturesque, moss-draped
grove, stands &ldquo;Windy Hill Manor&rdquo;, home of the Misses Stanton.</p>
<p>The records show that Windy Hill originally belonged to Joseph Ford. It was
under the ownership of Benjamin Osmun, a close friend of Aaron Burr, that the
place received its great historical interest.</p>
<p>After Aaron Burr had been accused of treason against his own country and
released on $5,000 bail, he was invited to be the guest of his old friend Benjamin
Osmun at Windy Hill.</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty years ago Benjamin Osmun sold this plantation to
General Brandon, great-grandfather of the Stanton sisters who now occupy it.
The Stantons gave the property the name of &ldquo;Windy Hill Manor&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Architecturally this house, like many of the cottage type ante-bellum homes,
is a surprise, when upon entering it is found to be of commodious proportions.</p>
<p>It is a story-and-a-half, plantation type home, with wide porch and large
columns across the front.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful spiral stairway in the wide front hall. To the left is a
large drawing room containing numerous relics of days long gone; portraits of
past generations; antique furniture, and a most interesting collection of Indian
relics. Also, an unusual fireplace and mantel are in this room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<div class="img" id="fig111">
<img src="images/p52a.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="671" height="800" />
</div>
<p>Time has marched on but Windy Hill Manor remains a living, vibrant picture
of the days of the ease and graciousness of the Old South. The Misses Stanton
complete the perfection of this period picture.</p>
<p>Here our visit to the old estates comes to an end. Lack of space has prevented
inclusion of all of the ante-bellum homes, but we hope that we have nevertheless
captured the charm of Natchez.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
